> *“Where we're going, we don't need roads.”* — *Back to the Future*  

નમસ્તે & Welcome to my personal GitHub. This profile is a digital archive of projects, tools, and ideas that bridge my dual roles as an educator and developer. Here, you'll find projects that extend beyond the classroom — designed to serve students, teachers, and developers alike.  

As a lecturer with over 20 years of experience in programming logic, mobile/web development, and ethical pedagogy, I approach coding with the same philosophy I bring to teaching: **incremental complexity**, **reproducibility**, and **clarity**. This space reflects that journey — one that is **constantly evolving**, just like the tools and ideas it contains.  

For my teaching work, you can visit my [work-based GitHub profile](https://github.com/jesselsookha), where I share resources directly linked to my curriculum.

## ∴ Design Principles

૧. Modular Thinking – Break problems into smaller, manageable parts.  
૨. Clarity and Readability – Code must be neat, clean, and easy to follow.  
૩. Incremental Complexity – Start simple, then build complexity gradually.  
૪. Reproducibility – Every project should be replicable and maintainable, allowing others to build upon it with confidence.

## ⌂ What This Profile Is Not

This profile is **not** a static academic repository. While many projects have educational value, the true intention is to foster collaboration — inviting others to build, modify, and improve these tools.

## ⟐ A Growing Collection

This space is **constantly evolving**, with new tools and projects added regularly. It will become **an open archive** — one that values process as much as product. Contributions and collaborations are welcome.
